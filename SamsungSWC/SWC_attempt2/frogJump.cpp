Given a 2 D matrix where 1 represent the places where the frog can jump and 0 represent the empty spaces,
the frog can move freely in horizontal direction (on 1’s only) without incurring any cost (jump). 
A vertical jump from a given point of the matrix to other point on the matrix can be taken (on 1’s only) 
with cost as the number of jumps taken.
Given a source and destination, the frog has to reach the destination minimizing the cost (jump).
